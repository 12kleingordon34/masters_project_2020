Code DOCUMENTATION INCOMPLETE

The general purposes of the files are as follows:

* `graph_plotting_gaussian.R` and `graph_plotting_network.R` plot figures for the random Gaussian and biological network results, respectively.
* `main_gaussian_xval.R`  and `main_network_xval.R` run the main hyperparameter validation experiments on the random Gaussian and biological networks, respectively.
* `generate_simulated_data.py` generates data from user-defined or random linear gaussian/gamma Bayesian Networks
* `sachs_script_cont.R` and `sachs_script_discrete.R` run experiments on the RAF Sachs data for continuous and discrete learning algorithms, respectively.
* `sim_gaussian_xval.R` and `sim_data_pathways.R` contain the xvalidation functions called in the random Gaussian and bio network main files, respectively.
* `utils.R` contains helper functions used across all files.
